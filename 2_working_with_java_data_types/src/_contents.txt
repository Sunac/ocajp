2. Working With Java Data Types

2.1 Declare and initialize variables (including casting of primitive data types)
Topics:
    Naming variables
    Number systems
    Primitive types

    Note: Strings covered later under Creating and Manipulating Strings

2.2 Differentiate between object reference variables and primitive variables
Topics:
    == operator with primitives and object references
